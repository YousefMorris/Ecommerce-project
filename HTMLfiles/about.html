            <p>At Smart Bee, we delight in a culture of warmth, enthusiasm, and respect. That’s why we express our concern for the planet not only through our sourcing and formulation principles, but also with every action we take as a company. From energy efficiency, to waste reduction and shipping recycling, Smart Bee is proud to be a Certified B Corporation, which means we define success in holistic terms that encompass not just profit, but people and Earth, too.
                Our Certified Carbonfree® products go through a rigorous life-cycle assessment to calculate their carbon emissions from field to shelf. For every unit of carbon that has been emitted, an equal amount is reduced through carbon offset programs like wind turbines and reforestation projects. The result? An overall neutral impact on the environment.
